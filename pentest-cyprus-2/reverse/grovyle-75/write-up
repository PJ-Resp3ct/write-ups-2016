The challenge consisted in an APK file (Android package) that we needed to reverse to find out the flag.
At first we wanted to execute it somewhere and see what it was but did not want to risk it on an actual phone. We then opted for an android emulator: LeapDroid.

Some text quotes could be seen but no flag here...
Then we decided to decompile the APK and used an online decompiler for this purpose: http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk

From the sources zip file obtained, we first searched for the word "quotes" with no luck, then for the actual text seen in some of the quotes but still had no luck.
At this stage we understood the content was somehow obfuscated and we'd need to dig into the sources.

The sources consisted in multiple java files but there were hundreds, we then searched for common encryption functions keywords such as "Base64" and found a first interesting class: C314a.java located in \com\dev\ck\pokemania.

It apparently reads from some resources and decode them in Base64 then as html characters. I suspected we were close but didn't know where were the quotes taken from.
Then browsing the same folder another class was found: MainActivity.java

This file apparently had some data encoded in Base64.

Decoding the longest one online from http://www.base64decode.org we saw that it consisted of a serie of hex characters encoded as HTML entities (as they start by &#x followed by an hex value and end with ;).

The data obtained was then cleaned from Notepad++ removing the special characters "&#x " and the ";", then pasted the raw data in an hex to ascii converter online:

The flag was there, at the end of the longest quote!
